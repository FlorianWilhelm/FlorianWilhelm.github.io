&lt;p&gt;The talk introduced a simulation framework that allows us to model individual preferences using gender-specific Dirichlet distributions. We then inject a configurable bias in favor of one gender and examine how this affects group-specific and overall matching efficiency. Our framework uses Total Variation Distance (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TVD&lt;/span&gt;) to systematically control and measure how much male and female preferences&amp;nbsp;diverge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To counteract bias, we compare traditional fixed quota mechanisms with a novel preference-based quota that dynamically aligns with group interests through aggregated top-choice voting. Our results show that while fixed quotas can be effective when group preferences are similar, they become inefficient under high divergence. In contrast, our proposed mechanism consistently delivers better fairness-efficiency trade-offs—even in challenging scenarios with strong bias and divergent&amp;nbsp;preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work provides practitioners with practical insights into the design of fairer algorithmic matching systems and emphasizes the importance of aligning interventions like quotas with actual group&amp;nbsp;preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

Titled &amp;#8220;Why Exceptions Are Just Sophisticated Gotos – and How to Move Beyond&amp;#8221;, the talk explores the historical context of exception handling, its parallels with the infamous goto statement, and why this comparison matters&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We trace the evolution from early control flow constructs to structured programming, showing how exceptions—initially introduced as a cleaner alternative—can lead to hidden control paths, harder-to-debug code, and performance issues when&amp;nbsp;misused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a modern alternative, the talk introduces result types, which are increasingly favored in languages like Rust, Haskell, and Golang for their clarity and predictability. We look at how these ideas translate into Python using the &lt;a href="https://returns.readthedocs.io/"&gt;returns&lt;/a&gt; package, demonstrating practical examples that make error handling more explicit and&amp;nbsp;robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session is ideal for intermediate to advanced Python developers interested in writing more maintainable code and embracing functional error-handling&amp;nbsp;patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

It was inspired by the quiz show &amp;#8220;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&amp;#8221; and the fact that our team was looking for a fun way to learn and test their Snowflake knowledge. We also drew inspiration from real-world &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; and Streamlit applications, as we wanted to combine common components into an easy-to-understand application that could be used for learning purposes by exploring the source&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our application crawls the Snowflake documentation at &lt;a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/"&gt;https://docs.snowflake.com/en/&lt;/a&gt; and saves it in a Snowflake table. This is done in an initialization step. The actual Snow Instructor app is now a &lt;a href="https://streamlit.io/"&gt;Streamlit&lt;/a&gt; app that reads a page from the stored Snowflake documentation and passes it to the Artic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; to generate a question. This question is now presented to the user as a quiz with four possible answers to choose from. The user selects an answer and is rewarded with points and snappy comments from the game master&amp;nbsp;:-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the cookiecutter template &lt;a href="https://github.com/FlorianWilhelm/the-hatchlor"&gt;hatchlor&lt;/a&gt; to start our Python project with a modern setup and common best practices. Then we used scrapy to scrape the Snowflake documentation, markdownify to shrink the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; pages without losing semantic information, typer and hatch to create command line scripts for the setup, the Snowflake &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Snowpark Python &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to access Snowflake, Snowpark as well as the Cortex functions, especially Artic, and finally Streamlit to link everything together. We also used the Snowflake &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; to make the deployment of the app on Snowflake really&amp;nbsp;easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very proud that our app demonstrates the key components of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;-based app to the user in a simple and fun way. Since our project setup utilizes the latest best-practice development methodologies as well as Snowflake features and tools, we provide a holistic yet simple overview of what is possible with Snowflake and Streamlit. We&amp;#8217;d also like to mention a few special tidbits, such as prefetching quiz questions using concurrent.futures and various advanced Streamlit features to top it all off&amp;nbsp;:-)&lt;/p&gt;

Perfect for Python&amp;nbsp;beginners!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the dynamic world of Python programming, an efficient project setup is key to success. Although our beloved Python emphasizes &lt;em&gt;There should be one&amp;#8212; and preferably only one &amp;#8212;obvious way to do it.&lt;/em&gt; in its Zen, we all know that it&amp;#8217;s rather Perl&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;There Is More Than One Way To Do It!&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to the nuts and bolts of a Python Package, like packaging, environment &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; dependency management, etc.
In my talk, which was presented at &lt;a href="https://pretalx.com/pyconde-pydata-2024/talk/CBVTEG/"&gt;PyConDE/PyData Berlin 2024&lt;/a&gt;, I demystify the process of setting up a Python project with clarity and efficiency. I&amp;#8217;ll introduce &lt;a href="https://hatch.pypa.io/"&gt;Hatch&lt;/a&gt;, a cutting-edge tool that simplifies project management. We&amp;#8217;ll delve into the functionalities and benefits of using pyproject.toml, a cornerstone in modern Python development for its streamlined approach to project&amp;nbsp;configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will also cover effective strategies for organizing your project&amp;#8217;s directory structure, ensuring a clean and manageable workspace. Understanding the importance of testing, we&amp;#8217;ll discuss unit testing techniques for enhancing code reliability. Additionally, the presentation will feature mypy for type checking, an essential practice for catching errors early and improving code quality. Finally, we&amp;#8217;ll explore the use of ruff, a modern linter, to keep your code clean and in line with Python&amp;nbsp;standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this presentation, you will have gained a comprehensive understanding of the tools and methodologies necessary for a modern Python project setup, empowering them to create well-structured, high-quality Python&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;
