The most effective of these methods do not apply sign constraints, such as non-negativity, to their factors. 
Despite their simplicity, the latent factors for users and items lack interpretability, which is becoming an increasingly important requirement. 
In this work, we provide a theoretical link between unconstrained and the interpretable &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization"&gt;non-negative matrix factorization&lt;/a&gt; in terms of the personalized ranking induced by these methods. 
We also introduce a novel, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation"&gt;latent Dirichlet allocation&lt;/a&gt;-inspired model for recommenders and extend our theoretical link to 
also allow the interpretation of an unconstrained matrix factorization as an adjoint formulation of our new model. 
Our experiments indicate that this novel approach represents the unknown processes of implicit user-item interactions in 
the real world much better than unconstrained matrix factorization while being&amp;nbsp;interpretable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I will give an introduction to different kinds of uncertainty, i.e. epistemic and aleatoric. To have a baseline for comparison, the classical method of Gaussian Processes for regression problems is presented. I then elaborate on different &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL&lt;/span&gt; methods for uncertainty quantification like Quantile Regression, Monte-Carlo Dropout, and Deep Ensembles. The talk is concluded with a comparison of these techniques to Gaussian Processes and the current state of the&amp;nbsp;art.&lt;/p&gt;

In our work, we demonstrate an end-to-end trainable question answering (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QA&lt;/span&gt;) system that allows a user to query an external NoSQL database by using natural language. A major challenge of such a system is the non-differentiability of database operations which we overcome by applying policy-based reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach on Facebook’s bAbI Movie Dialog dataset and achieve a competitive score of 84.2% compared to several benchmark models. We conclude that our approach excels with regard to real-world scenarios where knowledge resides in external databases and intermediate labels are too costly to gather for non-end-to-end trainable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;systems.&lt;/p&gt;

We evaluate generative adversarial networks (GANs) at the task of extracting information from vehicle registrations under a varying amount of labelled data and compare the performance with supervised learning techniques. Using unlabelled data shows a significant&amp;nbsp;improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Online vehicle marketplaces are embracing artificial intelligence to ease the process of selling a vehicle on their platform. The tedious work of copying information from the vehicle registration document into some web form can be automated with the help of smart text spotting systems. The seller takes a picture of the document and the necessary information is extracted&amp;nbsp;automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce the components of a text spotting system including the subtasks of object detection and character object recognition (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCR&lt;/span&gt;). In view of our use case, we elaborate on the challenges of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCR&lt;/span&gt; in documents with various distortions and artefacts which rule out off-the-shelve products for this&amp;nbsp;task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an introduction of semi-supervised learning based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), we evaluate the performance gains of this method compared to supervised learning. More specifically, for a varying amount of labelled data the accuracy of a convolution neural network (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt;) is compared to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GAN&lt;/span&gt; which uses additionally unlabelled data during the training&amp;nbsp;phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that GANs significantly outperform classical CNNs in use cases with a lack of labelled data. Regarding our use case of extracting information from vehicle registration documents, we show that our text spotting system easily exceeds an accuracy of 99.5% thus making it applicable in a real-world use&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;

Huge teams of well-payed data scientists often present one fancy model after the other to their managers but their proof of concepts never manifest into something business relevant. The frustration grows on both sides, managers and data&amp;nbsp;scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk I elaborate on the many reasons why data science to production is such a hard nut to crack. I start with a taxonomy of data use cases in order to easier assess technical requirements. Based thereon, my focus lies on overcoming the two-language-problem which is Python/R loved by data scientists vs. the enterprise-established Java/Scala. From my project experiences I present three different solutions, namely 1) migrating to a single language, 2) reimplementation and 3) usage of a framework. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach is presented and general advices based on the introduced taxonomy is&amp;nbsp;given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, my talk also addresses organisational as well as problems in quality assurance and deployment. Best practices and further references are presented on a high-level in order to cover all facets of data science to&amp;nbsp;production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my talk I hope to convey the message that breakdowns on the road from data science to production are rather the rule than the exception, so you are not alone. At the end of my talk, you will have a better understanding of why your team and you are struggling and what to do about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
