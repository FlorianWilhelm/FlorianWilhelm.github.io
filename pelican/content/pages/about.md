My name is **Florian Wilhelm** and I am a Data Scientist living in Cologne, Germany.

----------

I studied mathematics at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/)
with a focus on numerical mathematics and computer science as a subsidiary subject.
After my studies, I worked on
[Parallel Preconditioners for an Ocean Model in Climate Simulations](http://digbib.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/volltexte/documents/2049536)
and graduated from university (KIT) with a PhD degree. Main focus of my work was the
mathematical modelling of the governing equations of fluid dynamics in order to optimally
solve them with the help of high-performance computing (HPC) on a large-scale cluster.

As *Head of the Research Lab for Application and Innovation* at the Institute of Applied and
Numerical Mathematics, I worked in several industry-funded projects
and supervised several bachelor and master students.

----------

After my postdoctoral position I started as a Data Scientist at [Blue Yonder](http://www.blue-yonder.com/)
which is the leading platform provider for Predictive Applications and Big Data on the European market.
With more than three years of project experience in the field of Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics and
Big Data, I have acquired profound knowledge in the domains of mathematical modelling, statistics,
machine learning, high-performance computing and data mining.

For the last years I programmed mostly with the Python Data Science stack ([NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/),
[SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/), [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/),
[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/),
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), etc.) to which I also contributed several extensions.
Due to some project work I have also gained experience in R as well as
C/C++, Java, Matlab and Fortran.
