My name is **Florian Wilhelm** and I am a Data Scientist living in Cologne, Germany.

----------

I studied mathematics at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/)
with a focus on numerical mathematics and computer science as a subsidiary subject.
After my studies, I worked on
[Parallel Preconditioners for an Ocean Model in Climate Simulations](http://digbib.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/volltexte/documents/2049536)
and graduated from university (KIT) with a PhD degree. Main focus of my work was the
mathematical modelling of the governing equations of fluid dynamics in order to optimally
solve them with the help of high-performance computing (HPC) on a large-scale cluster.
As *Head of the Research Lab for Application and Innovation* at the Institute of Applied and
Numerical Mathematics, I worked in several industry-funded projects
and supervised bachelor and master students.

----------

After my postdoctoral position I started as a Data Scientist at [Blue Yonder](https://blueyonder.com/),
the leading provider of AI solutions for retail.
Right now I enjoy working on innovative Data Science projects with experts every day at [inovex](https://www.inovex.de/en/)
where I am *Head of Data Science*.
With more than eight years of project experience in the field of Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics and
Big Data, I have acquired profound knowledge in the domains of mathematical modelling, data science, statistics,
machine learning, high-performance computing and data mining.

For the last years I programmed mostly with the Python Data Science stack ([NumPy](https://numpy.org/),
[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/),
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/),
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), etc.) to which I also contributed several extensions.
Due to my participation in many industry projects, I have also gained much experience
in [Databricks Spark](https://databricks.com/de/spark/about), bringing data science to production and in general
the development of data products.
