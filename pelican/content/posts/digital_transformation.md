summary: This talk presented at the [EuroPython 2016](https://ep2016.europython.eu/conference/talks/handling-gps-data-with-python) introduces several Python libraries related to the handling of GPS data. The slides of this talk are available on [Github](https://github.com/FlorianWilhelm/gps_data_with_python) or on [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/FlorianWilhelm/gps_data_with_python/blob/master/talk.ipynb#/).

Ideas:

Post about how Deep Learning / Artificial Intelligence will impact the job market.
Hypothesis 1: People will do better jobs like it happend during the industrial revolution.

Argue that this is a funny point since people with a Big Data background are using a sample size of 1 to predict
the future!! Also show plot with what human's intelligence can possible do with a normal distribution. Then a
distribution in the same graph of another normal distribution where most people are currently working on, so
x-axis is the human's brain potential. Now starting from left the aumtomatisation and AI is catching up letting
curve of where people are working slide more and more to the right reaching the actual potential.
Now argue that after a certain point in time people will reach that potential and unemployment rate will rise.
Also argue that we are seeing this right now since money has a mass and the more mass you have the more likely
you are to attract more mass. If you have not much mass the more likely you will lose your mass to someone with
more mass just like in a galaxy with black holes. So in the current economical system middle class is
actually in an unstable state (compare to electron in atom) and people will either lose and become poor or rich
since these states are much more stable.
