In this presentation held at the [EuroPython 2014](https://ep2014.europython.eu/)
in Berlin, my colleague Felix Wick demonstrates that setting up a new Python project
from scratch can be quite complicated. Especially, structuring your files and directories
the right way in order to build a Python package.
Thereby, questions are addressed like "Where should my modules, documentation and
unit tests go?" and "How do I configure setup.py, Sphinx and so on?" with proven answers!
Finally, the template tool [PyScaffold](http://pyscaffold.readthedocs.org/) is demonstrated
that I developed at [Blue Yonder](http://www.blue-yonder.com/). PyScaffold extremely
simplifies the process of setting up a new Python project and is freely available to anyone.
