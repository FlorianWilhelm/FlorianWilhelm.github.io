:summary: Setting up a new Python project can be quite cumbersome and complex.
  This talk provides details on how to structure a Python package and introduces PyScaffold as a project template tool.

In this presentation held at the `EuroPython 2014 <https://ep2014.europython.eu/>`_
in Berlin, my colleague Felix Wick demonstrates that setting up a new Python project
from scratch can be quite complicated. Especially, structuring your files and directories
the right way in order to build a Python package.
Thereby, he addresses questions like "Where should my modules, documentation and
unit tests go?" and "How do I configure setup.py, Sphinx and so on?" with proven answers!
Finally, he demonstrates the template tool `PyScaffold <http://pyscaffold.readthedocs.org/>`_
which helps a lot in setting up a new project.
