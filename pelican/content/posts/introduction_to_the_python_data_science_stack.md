Often I get the question as a Data Scientist what the *Python Data Science Stack*
actually is and where a beginner should start to learn. The Python ecosystem,
especially around the topics data analytics, data science and machine learning is
so vast and rich that it confuses many rookies.

For such an audience I created a slide deck that starts with pointing out the
benefits of the Python language for analytics. Even beginners in Python are
addressed by some slides that explain the syntax of Python and how to get
started. After that some slides present the most important packages of the data
science stack, namely [NumPy][], [SciPy][], [Pandas][], [Scikit-Learn][],
[Jupyter][] and [IPython][]. The merits of Jupyter are best shown in a live
demonstration to convey its power. The interplay between Pandas and
Scikit-Learn is shown based on Kaggle's [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster][]
dataset. Eventually, an outlook to further libraries in the data science domain
are presented.
