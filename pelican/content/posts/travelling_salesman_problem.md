*CLICKBAIT and I fell for it!* you are surely thinking. Of course you know that
[traveling salesman][] is [NP-hard][] and proving it would mean to show that
[P = NP][]. This again would mean at least a [Turing award][] if not a [Fields medal][]
(given that the author is under 40) and maybe even the fucking Nobel Committee
would get down off its high horse and finally admit that mathematics is the
mother of all sciences, thus being *especially* beneficial to mankind and award
a price. But let's face it, take a look at the man in the mirror, you just came
here to see where the error lies to feel superior and yet you are right *and* I am.
A common mathematical trick is if something is too difficult, just add another condition and
see what happens. Just like there are special cases for [elliptic curve cryptography][]
that are easy to solve.
