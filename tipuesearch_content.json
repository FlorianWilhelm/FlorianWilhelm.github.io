I studied mathematics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology ( KIT ) with a focus on numerical mathematics and computer science as a subsidiary subject. After my studies, I worked on Parallel Preconditioners for an Ocean Model in Climate Simulations and graduated from university ( KIT ) with a PhD degree. Main focus of my work was the mathematical modelling of the governing equations of fluid dynamics in order to optimally solve them with the help of high-performance computing ( HPC ) on a large-scale cluster. As Head of the Research Lab for Application and Innovation at the Institute of Applied and Numerical Mathematics, I worked in several industry-funded projects and supervised several bachelor and master students. After my postdoctoral position I started as a Data Scientist at Blue Yonder which is the leading platform provider for Predictive Applications and Big Data on the European market. With more than three years of project experience in the field of Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics and Big Data, I have acquired profound knowledge in the domains of mathematical modelling, statistics, machine learning, high-performance computing and data mining. For the last years I programmed mostly with the Python Data Science stack ( NumPy , SciPy , Scikit-Learn , Pandas , Matplotlib , Jupyter , etc.) to which I also contributed several extensions. Due to some project work I have also gained experience in R as well as C/C++, Java, Matlab and Fortran.

The secure and recommended OAuth2 protocol is used to authorize the bot application in the Google Developers Console in order to access the Google+ Hangouts API . Subsequently, I explain how to use an event-driven library to write a bot that sends scheduled messages, waits for a proper reply and repeats the question if need be. Thereby, a primer on event-driven, asynchronous architectures is given. The source code can be downloaded on GitHub and the slides are available as html preview .","tags":"Talks","title":"How to write a friendly reminder bot"},{"url":"/2014/07/extending_scikit-learn_with_your_own_regressor/","text":"Scikit-Learn is a well-known and popular framework for machine learning that is used by Data Scientists all over the world. In this tutorial presented at the EuroPython 2014 in Berlin, I show in a practical way how you can add your own estimator following the interfaces of Scikit-Learn. First a small introduction to the design of Scikit-Learn and its inner workings is given. Then I show how easily Scikit-Learn can be extended by creating an own estimator. In order to demonstrate this, I extend Scikit-Learn by the popular and robust Theil-Sen Estimator that was not in Scikit-Learn until version 0.16. I also motivate this estimator by outlining some of its superior properties compared to the ordinary least squares method (LinearRegression in Scikit-Learn).","tags":"Talks","title":"Extending Scikit-Learn with your own Regressor"},{"url":"/2014/07/howto_setup_a_new_python_project/","text":"In this presentation held at the EuroPython 2014 in Berlin, my colleague Felix Wick demonstrates that setting up a new Python project from scratch can be quite complicated. Especially, structuring your files and directories the right way in order to build a Python package. Thereby, questions are addressed like \"Where should my modules, documentation and unit tests go?\" and \"How do I configure setup.py, Sphinx and so on?\" with proven answers! Finally, the template tool PyScaffold is demonstrated that I developed at Blue Yonder . PyScaffold extremely simplifies the process of setting up a new Python project and is freely available to anyone.","tags":"Talks","title":"How to Setup a new Python Project"},{"url":"/2013/10/handling_big_data_with_python/","text":"The talk presented at the PyCon 2013 in Cologne gives a small introduction of how Blue Yonder applies machine learning and Predictive Analytics in various fields as well as the challenges of Big Data. Using the example of Blue Yonder's machine learning software NeuroBayes, I show the made efforts and hit dead ends in order to provide a flexible and yet easy to use interface for NeuroBayes to Data Scientists. Since NeuroBayes is written in FORTRAN for performance reasons different interface approaches were tried which lead us eventually to a Python interface. In this talk, I elaborate on the up- and downsides of the different approaches and the various reasons why Python won the race with an emphasize on the benefits of the Python ecosystem itself. Also, I discuss performance as well as scalability issues with Python and how we address them at Blue Yonder. In detail, I show the application of Cython to speed up calculations in the Python interface layer as well as distributed computing in a private cloud called Stratosphere. Scalability and efficiency is of utmost importance when data processing is time critical. The overall goal is to give the audience an overview how Python fits in the software ecosystem of a company handling Big Data.","tags":"Talks","title":"Handling Big Data with Python"}]}
